# Case Workflow
## A case is initiated (how? Phone call, email, etc?)
## In order to track incoming (arriving) cases record the following:
	* Doctor
	* Patient Name (first, last)
	* BKD ?? (what is this again?)
	* Material and Units
## From the information in the previous step calculate the following:
	* Turnover weeks (turn/wks)
		```E and D materials are 3 week turnover```
		``` Z and I materials are 4 week turnover```
	* ID
		```First two letters of the first and last name```
		```Jane Doe would be JADO```
	* RCV ?? (is this the expected date of arrival to lab?  Is it always 2 days?)
		```BKD + 2 days```
	* Ship (expected date of ship from lab?)
		```Due date - 6 days```
  * Due (due back to Doctor?)
